# Machine-Learning-1
This is the repository of the university class "Machine Learning 1"

## Structure and overview

This repository contains three folders, each folder is corresponding to one project.

Each "Week ~" folder contains Jupyter Notebook, pdf file of the output, and dataset.

* [Week 4](https://github.com/saisai00/Machine-Learning-1/tree/main/week-4)
  - Plot the dataset using Histogram and Scatterplot
  - Implement my own OLS estimator
  - Compare my implementation to sklearn
  - Regularization with ridge regression
  - Cross-validation
* [Week 8](https://github.com/saisai00/Machine-Learning-1/tree/main/week-8)
  - Explore the MNIST dataset
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis to separate the classes
  - MNIST with Logistic Regression using sklearn
  - MNIST with simple Keras Fully connected neural network
  - MNIST with simple Keras CNN
* [Week 10](https://github.com/saisai00/Machine-Learning-1/tree/main/week-10)
  - Linear dimensionality reduction with PCA
  - Comparison with PCA implemented by sklearn
  - Nonlinear dimensionality reduction with t-SNE
  - Cluster the data using k-Means
  - Clustering using Gaussian Mixture Models (currently being done)
